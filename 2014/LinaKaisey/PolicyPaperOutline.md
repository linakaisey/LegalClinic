# 1. Introduction and Underlying Principles

## a. Trust Networks

i. Combination of contract law and computer science principles

ii. Individuals have different “rings” (exchange networks) for different facets of life

## b. Analogue between information as we might conceive it, and money as we currently conceive it:

i. Money: Given to a bank until individual wishes to withdraw it. Bank retains general/aggregate info even after money is withdrawn, but bank does not retain money. Individual knows where money goes and who holds it.

ii. Same with entities holding your information: retain only aggregate information; individual can decide to sever ties and withdraw individual information 

## c. Davos standards

i. Provenance

ii. Permissions

iii. Auditable 

iv. Do not track



# 2. Government Collection of Data: Metadata on the Metadata

## a. NSA or other government agency must ask specifically for the information it wants

## b. If data is stored in multiple stores across multiple jurisdictions, need acquiescence in each jurisdiction in order to access all the stores, and therefore, all the data.

## c. Based on the quantity and nature of queries, can point out unusual variance in government’s requests

## d. Mechanism:

i. Governmental Regulation creates the requirement for devolved repositories of data

ii. The data may be held by private entities (perhaps with oversight to ensure vigilant guarding  of the data)



# 3. Corporate Collection of Data: ClearButton

## a. Government regulations afford individuals the right to access information about themselves

i. Current examples: medical records, credit records

## b. The same right will attach to knowledge about what information corporations have about individuals

## c. Mechanism:

i. Government regulation creates the requirement for corporations to disclose information to the ClearButton registry  

ii. Individuals sign up for ClearButton in a similar fashion to the “do not call” registry  

iii. Individuals receive periodic emails once new information about them is being stored  

iv. Individuals click on a link to be taken to the ClearButton notifications center, which in turn contains links to the sites of corporations that have data about the individual



# 4. Individual use of data: Personal Data Stores

##a. Individual keeps all the data that the government or a corp has about them in a PDS.

## b. Benefits: 

i. Increased transparency – each individual knows what information the government/corporation has about them

ii. Decreased paperwork – individuals can auto-fill documents with information in their PDS that has already been certified

iii. Value add for users – aggregated data is used to improve services

## c. Mechanism: 

i. Individuals put information into the PDS

ii. Data is shared with the government/corporation in an aggregated, anonymous way

iii. Government/corporation uses data to add value for businesses


## d. Current example: Kansas Personal Data Store (PDS) for Small Businesses
